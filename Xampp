#Xampp
I found the solution:

Make sure port 80 is not being used (Use Network Utility and scan for port 80. If you found any application using port 80, then kill it)
Open terminal and execute

`sudo apachectl stop` 

(ignore, if you get any error)

On the same terminal window execute

`sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/apachectl start`

Open XAMPP control panel, your apache server might have started by now, if not then you can start manually by clicking start button.

This worked for me!!
